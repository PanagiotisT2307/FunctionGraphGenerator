# FunctionGraphGenerator
This is a simple function graph generator made with python.

## How To Use It
Enter all the important fields which are all the fields that got the star \"*\"
then press \"Generate Graph\" and a new window will pop up. In the window that popped up
you got some features to navigate in the graph and save it as image.

One more thing you can do is to press the button \"show operations\" to see what operations
you can use.

## Version of Python
The program was made in python 3.9, so it is working well from this version and later.
Don't know for previous versions
